## File TODO

`cdg` files reside in a `.mp3g` or `.mp3+g` archive next to its sibling `.mp3`. Naming may or may not be significant between the archive, music file, and `.cdg`. As such assuming significance is reccomended.

```file
ðŸ“¦ song-title.mp3g
â”œâ”€ðŸ“„ song-title.mp3
â””â”€ðŸ“„ song-title.cdg
```
